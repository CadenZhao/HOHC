# Analysis of Hormone-Mediated Human Inter-Organ Communications

This study explores the intricate crosstalk between hormones and their receptors (HRs) across human tissues and organs. By curating hormone-HR pairing information and hormone secretion sources through literature and database searches, we constructed tissue/organ-hormone-HR networks using GTEx RNA-seq data.

## Key Highlights

- **Gender-Specific Networks**: Separate networks for male and female tissues reveal notable differences in reproductive-related organs and their HRs.
- **Hormone Types and Origins**:
  - Peptide hormones dominate most tissues/organs.
  - Amino acid-derived hormones are primarily secreted by the adrenal gland and brain.
  - Lipid-derived hormones are mostly produced by the liver, adrenal gland, and reproductive organs.
- **Regulation Patterns**:
  - The brain is the central regulator, influencing most tissues/organs, followed by endocrine glands and digestive organs.
  - Membrane HRs are the predominant interaction targets for most hormones.

These insights provide a foundation for understanding hormone-mediated inter-organ communications and their gender-specific nuances.
